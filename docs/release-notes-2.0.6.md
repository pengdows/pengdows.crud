# pengdows.crud 2.0.6 release notes (in progress)

2.0.6 is binary compatible with 2.0.5 (package validation against 2.0.5 for `pengdows.crud`,
`pengdows.crud.abstractions` and `pengdows.crud.fakeDb`). This file collects behavior changes a
2.0.5 user can notice; the release (REL-008) completes it.

## Reads that now fail instead of returning a wrong value

- A `[Json]` column holding text that isn't valid JSON for the property type fails the read with
  `DataMappingException` naming the column. 2.0.5 returned `null`/default silently (DEC-008).

## TiDB

- Upserts of `UInt64` columns (`BIT(64)`, `BIGINT UNSIGNED`) no longer go through `VALUES(col)`,
  which TiDB returns byte-reversed for `BIT(64)`: a single-row upsert sets the column from its own
  parameter, and a batch upsert of such an entity runs one statement per row (DEC-012).

## pengdows.crud.fakeDb

fakeDb behaves like the provider it emulates. Each change below was checked against the real
driver (Microsoft.Data.Sqlite, DuckDB.NET, Npgsql, SqlClient) on 2026-10-04 (DEC-009). A test that
passed on 2.0.5 and fails now was relying on behavior no real provider has.

| Behavior | 2.0.5 | 2.0.6 | Real providers |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Open()` on an open connection | returned silently | throws `InvalidOperationException`; a no-op when emulating SQLite | SqlClient, Npgsql, DuckDB.NET throw; Microsoft.Data.Sqlite returns |
| `GetOrdinal` of a missing column | returned -1 | throws `IndexOutOfRangeException` | every provider tested throws (25 of 30 targets exactly `IndexOutOfRangeException`) |
| `ConnectionTimeout` default | 0 | 15, or the connection string's value | 15 on Microsoft.Data.Sqlite, Npgsql, SqlClient |
| `Database` | the emulated product's name (e.g. `"Sqlite"`) | the connection string's `Database`/`Initial Catalog`, else `""`; `"main"` when emulating SQLite, the data source when emulating DuckDB | what each provider reports |
| Minimum pool size above maximum | accepted | rejected with `ArgumentException` | Npgsql and SqlClient reject |
| `fakeDbFactory.CreateDataSource` | .NET's default data source | .NET's default data source; `SupportsNativeDataSource = true` returns a `FakeDbDataSource` | providers without their own data source return .NET's default |
