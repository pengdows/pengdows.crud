/// <summary>
/// SINGLE WRITER CONNECTION STRATEGY - DESIGN INTENT:
///
/// PURPOSE: Optimized for databases that allow unlimited concurrent readers but only ONE writer.
/// Maintains one persistent writer connection and creates ephemeral read-only connections as needed.
///
/// BEHAVIOR:
/// - Writes: Always use the single persistent writer connection (never dispose)
/// - Reads: Create ephemeral read-only connections with read-only hints applied
/// - The persistent writer connection is held for the entire DatabaseContext lifetime
/// - Read connections are disposed immediately after use
///
/// DATABASE EXAMPLES:
/// - SQL Server Compact Edition (SQLCE) - single writer limitation
/// - SQLite/DuckDB with WAL or shared in-memory cache - benefits from persistent writer
/// - File-based databases where write locks are expensive to acquire
/// - Any database with single-writer/multi-reader architecture
///
/// THREAD SAFETY:
/// - Writer connection: Protected by database-level write locking
/// - Reader connections: Each request gets its own ephemeral connection
///
/// PERFORMANCE BENEFITS:
/// - Eliminates write lock acquisition overhead on every operation
/// - Read operations don't interfere with the persistent writer
/// - Optimal for applications with mixed read/write workloads
///
/// DO NOT MODIFY: This strategy is specifically designed for single-writer database constraints
/// </summary>
